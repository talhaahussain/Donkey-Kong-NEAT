# Donkey-Kong-NEAT
A Python program to play the first or second level of Donkey Kong Country (SNES, 1996), Jungle Hijinks or Ropey Rampage, using the genetic algorithm NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) and Gymnasium, a maintained fork of OpenAI's Gym. 

### Prerequisites

Requires a valid ROM file (`.sfc`) of Donkey Kong Country, USA version, Rev 2 (SHA-1 sum: cd606e77ab2034438e06891cd2d067dad69b4d1a). 

**Please check that you have this specific ROM version, as other versions of Donkey Kong may not work.**

pyenv must be installed, as well as Python version 3.8 (through pyenv). Details for how this may be done can be seen [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
